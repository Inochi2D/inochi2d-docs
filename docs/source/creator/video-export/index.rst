    FFMPEG is needed for video export! Without it the option will be grayed out.  

    If you're not sure whether ffmpeg is installed on your system you can run the following in your command prompt/terminal!
    
    .. code-block::
      :linenos:

      ffmpeg --version
    

If FFMPEG is not installed continue to the :doc:`Installing FFMPEG <ffmpeg>` section.

Otherwise continue to the :doc:`The Export Video Dialog <exporting>` section.
